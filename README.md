# flutter_api

A practice flutter project to have a first touch with API integration

## What it does

Basically renders a simple list of Posts taken from the [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API using the `/posts` endpopint [link](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)

With some basic styles and a loader renders the Posts straight in the home page.
